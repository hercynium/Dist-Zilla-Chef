     The "stock" command now has an --author option, to stock
     author-time dependencies as well.  This was stolen from the
     original DZ "listdeps" command.

     When creating the "pantry", we now automatically configure it to
     use the appropriate type of Store, based on the presence of VCS
     files (i.e. .git or .svn directories).
     
     Now requires Pinto 0.029 or newer.
